        <p>
          I have experience working with a variety of programming languages and
          frameworks, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I
          have worked on a number of projects, ranging from simple websites to
          full-stack applications. I am always looking for new opportunities to
          learn and grow as a developer, and I am excited to see what the future
          holds.
